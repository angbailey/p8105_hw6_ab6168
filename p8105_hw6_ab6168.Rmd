## Problem 1

Reading in data
```{r}
homicide_data = read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv")
```

Data cleaning
```{r}
homicide_data = homicide_data |> 
  #creating city_state variable and binary variable for solved/unsolved homicides
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state), 
         homicide_solved = if_else(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0)    
         ) |> 
  #filtering states and race
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX",
                            "Phoenix, AZ",
                            "Kansas City, MO",
                            "Tulsa, AL"),
         victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) |> 
  #victim age as numeric
  mutate(victim_age = suppressWarnings(as.numeric(victim_age)))
